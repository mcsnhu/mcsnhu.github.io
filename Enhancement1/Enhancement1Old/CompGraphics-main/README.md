How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?

I think my main takeaway from this course besides picking up the actual mechanical skill of rendering things via programs is that depending on the resources available to you it's reasonable to aim for more achievable goals. For instance, originally I had wanted to render each leaf as its own shape, however, doing so would have taken a decent bit of extra time and work so I opted to use a textured sphere instead. While this may seem like cutting corners, it is actually moreso just being able to recognize what is possible within a certain timeframe of a project and adjusting accordingly.


How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?

I cannot say that my approach to programming has appreciably changed over the course of this course, however, I did appreciate how this course was set up so that one would learn all the skills they needed for the final project via the weekly milestones before said projedt was actually due.


How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?

Computer science is simply the was of the future as we as a people become more and more technologically advanced, computational graphics is simply one factor of this. Whenever in the future a task calls for computer graphics I will at least have some insight.
